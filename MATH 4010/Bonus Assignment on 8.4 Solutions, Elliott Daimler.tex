\section*{1}

Claim: Let $K$ and $N$ be subgroups of a group $G$, with $N$ normal in $G$, and let $NK = \{ nk | n \in N, k \in K \}$.  
Then $K/(N \cap K)$ is isomorphic to $NK/N$.  

\begin{proof}
    By Exercise 20 of section 8.2, $NK$ is a subgroup of $G$ that contains both $K$ and $N$.  
    We will complete the remainder of the proof in three parts. 
    \subsection*{a}
    First, to show that $N$ is a normal subgroup of $NK$, let $g \in G$ be given.  Since 
    $N$ is normal in $G$, we have $gng^{-1}$.  Now let $a \in NK$ be given.  Since $NK$ is a 
    subgroup of $G$, we have $ana^{-1}$ where $g = a \in NK$, so $N$ is a subgroup of $NK$.

    \subsection*{b}
    Next, consider the map $f:K \rightarrow NK/N$ given by $f(k) = Nk$.  This can be rewritten as 
    $Nk = nk$ for $n \in N$, $k \in K$.  The kernel of $f$ is all $k \in K$ such that 
    $f(k) = N$, or $\{ k \in K | nk \in N \}$.  Since every $n$ is in $N$, this is 
    $\{ k \in K | k \in N \}$ or $K \cap N$.  Every $k \in K$ is also in $NK$, so $f$ is 
    surjective.

    \subsection*{c}
    Last, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, the map $f: K \rightarrow NK/N$ with kernel $N \cap K$ 
    implies that the quotient group $K/(N \cap K)$ is isomorphic to $NK/N$.
\end{proof}
