\section*{Exercise 6.10}

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space made by an indiscrete topology on $X$, and let $U$ be a proper nonempty subset of $X$.  
Since $X$ is the only nonempty open set in $\mathcal{T}$, any covering $\mathcal{C}$ of $U$ must be of the form $\mathcal{C} = X$, which 
is finite, so $U$ is compact.  The complement of $U$ is not open in $(X, \mathcal{T})$, so $U$ is not closed. 


\section*{Exercise 6.11} 

Given some topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and subsets $A$ and $B$, in order for the intersection of  
$A$ and $B$ to be necessarily compact, we should impose the additional restriction that 
the intersection of $A$ and $B$ is closed.  Then, by Theorem 6.7, $A \cup B$ is compact, and 
we can treat $A \cap B$ as a closed subspace of $X$; by Theorem 6.8, this subspace
inherits compactness from $A \cup B$.  We can extend the intersection to finitely many subsets of $X$ with the condition 
that the resulting intersection is closed.



\section*{Exercise 6.16}

Let $(\mathbb{Q}, \mathcal{T}_{std})$ be the topological subspace of rationals with the standard topology inherited from $\mathbb{R}_{std}$.  
For the constant $\pi$, the intervals $(-\infty, -\pi)$ and $(\pi, \infty)$ are open in $\mathbb{R}_{std}$, so $(-\infty, -\pi) \cap \mathbb{Q}$ 
and $(\pi, \infty) \cap \mathbb{Q}$ are both open in $(\mathbb{Q}, \mathcal{T}_{std})$.  Their complement $[-\pi, \pi] \cap \mathbb{Q}$, henceforth $A$,  
is bounded and closed in $(\mathbb{Q}, \mathcal{T}_{std})$, but we can construct an open cover of $A$ that has no finite subcover.\\ 
\\ 
Let $\mathcal{C} = \{ (x, y) | x < y \quad and \quad x, y \in A \}$ be an open cover of $A$.  For any finite subset $\mathcal{C}'$ of 
$\mathcal{C}$, there is some $y_0 < \pi$ such that for every interval $(x, y) \in \mathcal{C}'$, $y \leq y_0$ and there is an $x_0 > -\pi$ such that 
for every interal $(x, y) \in \mathcal{C}'$, $x \leq x_0$.  But there are rationals $y_1, x_1 \in A$ where $y_0 < y_1 < \pi$ and $-\pi < x_1 < x_0$, so 
$y_1$ and $x_1$ are not contained in $\mathcal{C}'$ and $\mathcal{C}'$ does not cover $A$.
